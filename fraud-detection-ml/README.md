# 🕵️ Fraud Detection using Machine Learning
This repository contains a **Jupyter Notebook** that demonstrates fraud detection using **machine learning models**. The notebook walks through data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, evaluation, and comparison of algorithms.
## 🚀 Features
- 📊 Data cleaning and preprocessing for fraud detection  
- 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for insights  
- 🤖 ML models: Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.  
- 📈 Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score  
- ⚖️ Model comparison with insights on fraud detection  
## 🧠 Tech Stack
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)  
- Pandas, NumPy (Data handling)  
- Scikit-learn (ML models)  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (Visualization)

## ⚙️ How to Run
1. Clone the repo:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/KrMayank789/fraud-detection-ml.git
cd fraud-detection-ml
```
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):  
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
```
3. Install dependencies:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook:  
```bash
jupyter notebook MayankKumar_Fraud_JupyterNotebook.ipynb
```
## 📊 Results
- ✅ **Random Forest** performed better in precision compared to Decision Tree  
- ✅ Precision is prioritized since in fraud detection catching fraud is more important than minimizing false positives  
- ✅ The notebook highlights trade-offs and the importance of choosing the right metric
